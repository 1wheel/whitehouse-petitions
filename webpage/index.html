	<div id="faq">
		<span class='q'>What am I looking at?</span><br />
		The White House website allows citizens to create and sign petitions; I've downloaded the signer's first name and location to map where they are from and chart the rate of signing.
		<br /><br />

		<span class='q'>Where is the petition I'm looking for?</span><br />
		Currently the site only examines unanswered petitions with a large number of signatures - this may change in the future, but until then you're out of luck. I add petitions manually and it is possible I've missed one. If that is the case, feel free to send me an email: adam.r.pearce at gmail.com 		
		<br /><br />

		<span class='q'>Why don't these numbers match the one of the White House page?</span><br />
		Signitures are only counted if they have a recognizable name and location. It is also possible that the daily update script has run into a problem.  
		<br /><br />

		<span class='q'>Are there any more statistics about the petitions?</span><br />
		Based on name and location, I've derived estimations about party affiliation and age for each petition. They aren't nearly as accurate as gender so they aren't currently included; I'm planning on adding an 'advanced view' to the table including them.
